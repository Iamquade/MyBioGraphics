			<h4>Achievements</h4>
			<h3>In April 2020, I graduated from Marinduque Victorians College with a General Academic Strand (GAS) course. At the time, I was a platoon captain and a model student at the school. I was the one who was supposed to keep them in order every morning and afternoon, which is why I was picked to be a platoon commander. I'm not used to being in charge, but if it's for physical activities, I'd want to be in charge since I enjoy doing them, even if I'm not physically fit because I used to be very tiny. I was also the MVP of our intramural basketball and volleyball teams because I was so talented at the time and could carry the entire team.
