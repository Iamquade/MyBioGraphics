			<h4>About</h4>
			<h3>I'm Christopher Peralta, a Marinduque State College BSI/T student. On January 22, 2001, I was born in Dr. Damian Reyes Memorial Hospital, although I grew up in Brgy. Uno Buenavista, Marinduque. I am the family's youngest kid. I enjoy playing basketball and volleyball. But when a pandemic strikes, I just play mobile games. I enjoy playing games but today my attention is on assisting my elder brother in our business. Aside from that, I am also focusing on my studies in the hopes of not failing any subjects.My greatest successes, I believe, were graduating from senior high school and continuing to study. That's all I can say for now since I'm simply preparing for my main achievements, which are to acquire a job and make my family pleased of what I accomplished.
                My goal was to become an IT specialist or a police officer eventually, and I believe I'll be able to achieve it after I graduate. It was also a goal of mine to graduate as soon as possible, to be successful, and to have a happy family.
                When I was in lower school, my accomplishments included getting great grades and being an achiever, winning prizes for certain activities or subjects, becoming an MVP in senior high basketball and volleyball, receiving the perfect attendance award, and receiving scholarships.
                My life's passion has always been athletics, but I also like gaming, going to relaxing locations, and watching movies.
